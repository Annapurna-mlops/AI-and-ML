    "1. **Two Sum:** Given an array of numbers and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target sum.\n",
    "   - Solution: Use a dictionary to store seen numbers and their indices. For each new element, check if the complement (target - element) exists in the dictionary.\n",
    "2. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:** Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place and return the new length of the array without duplicates.\n",
    "   - Solution: Use two pointers, one slow and one fast. The slow pointer keeps track of the unique elements, and the fast pointer iterates through the array. If the current element is not the same as the element pointed to by the slow pointer, it means a duplicate wasn't encountered yet. Update the slow pointer to point to the current element, effectively keeping only unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pascals Triangle:** Given an integer numRows, return a list of n pascals triangle rows (where `n` is the number of rows).\n",
    "   - Solution: You can use a nested loop to iterate through rows and elements. However, since tuples are immutable, consider creating a new tuple for each row with the calculated values.\n",
    "4. **Product of Array Except Self:** Given an integer array nums, return an array where the ith element is the product of all the elements in nums except the ith element.\n",
    "   - Solution: Use two passes with a list (mutable). In the first pass, calculate the product of all elements to the left of each index. In the second pass, calculate the product of all elements to the right of each index and multiply it with the previously calculated left product for each index. Finally, convert the list to a tuple (immutable) for the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Contains Duplicate:** Given an integer array nums, return `True` if any element appears in the array more than once and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "   - Solution: Use a set to store seen numbers. If adding a new element to the set fails (meaning a duplicate exists), return `True`. Otherwise, the loop continues, and `False` is returned at the end.\n",
    "6. **Intersection of Two Arrays:** Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return the intersection of the two arrays.\n",
    "   - Solution: Convert one of the arrays to a set and iterate through the other array. If an element exists in the set, it's part of the intersection, so add it to the result list. Finally, convert the list to a set to remove duplicates if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Two Sum (Dictionary Approach):** Given an array of numbers and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target sum.\n",
    "   - Solution: Use a dictionary to store seen numbers and their indices. Iterate through the array and for each element, check if the complement (target - element) exists in the dictionary. If it does, you've found the two numbers.\n",
    "8. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:** Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "   - Solution: Use a dictionary to store the last seen index of each character. As you iterate through the string, keep track of the start index of the current substring. If you encounter a duplicate character, update the start index to be the max of the current start index and the last seen index of the duplicate character + 1 (to skip the duplicate). Keep track of the maximum length of the substring seen so far.\n",
