    "**Classes and Their Templates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept:** A class acts as a blueprint or template that defines the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will possess.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Allocation:** When you define a class, Python allocates memory for the class object itself, which stores the class's definition (including attribute names, method definitions, and potentially some internal data structures). However, this memory allocation is typically minimal compared to what objects might hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects and Instances:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creation:** When you create an object (instance) of a class, Python allocates memory for that specific object. This memory space holds the object's attributes (variables) and a reference to the class it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attribute Values:** The object's attributes store actual data values specific to that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference to Class:** Each object has a reference (memory address) that points back to the class object that defined it. This reference allows the object to access the class's methods and shared attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classes store their templates in memory, but these templates are relatively small compared to individual objects.\n",
    "- Objects are allocated separate memory to hold their specific attribute values and a reference to their class.\n",
    "- This way, multiple objects of the same class can have different data while sharing the class's definition."

    "\n",
    "**Classes and Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design a class `Student` with attributes like name, roll_number, and marks (list of scores). Include methods to calculate the total marks and average score.\n",
    "2. Create a class `Rectangle` with attributes for width and height. Implement methods to calculate the area and perimeter.\n",
    "3. Define a class `Employee` with attributes like name, salary, and department. Include methods to apply a raise and display employee information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a base class `Animal` with attributes like name and type (e.g., mammal, bird). Define a method `make_sound` that prints a generic sound. Derive subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` from `Animal` and override the `make_sound` method to provide specific sounds.\n",
    "2. Design a class `Vehicle` with attributes like make, model, and year. Implement methods to start the engine and display vehicle information. Create subclasses `Car` and `Motorcycle` that inherit from `Vehicle` and add their own attributes (e.g., num_doors for Car, engine_size for Motorcycle).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a base class `Shape` with an abstract method `calculate_area`. Derive subclasses `Square` and `Circle` from `Shape` that implement the `calculate_area` method with their specific formulas. Write a function `get_total_area` that takes a list of `Shape` objects and calculates the total area of all shapes.\n",
    "2. Design a function `greet` that takes an object as an argument. If the object has a method `say_hello`, call that method. Otherwise, print a generic greeting. Use this function with objects of different classes that might or might not have a `say_hello` method to demonstrate polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a class `BankAccount` with attributes like account_number (private) and balance (protected). Implement methods to deposit and withdraw funds (with appropriate checks) and a public method to get the current balance.\n",
